# It takes 365.25 days to orbit the Sun. So if we just made the year 365 days long, 
# at the end of the year, we'd be a tiny bit behind (roughly 0.24Â°) in our position 
# in orbit. Over the years, that error would accumulate, and before you know it, April 
# would be mid-winter (this actually happened before they got the calendar straightened out.)

# There's more: The year isn't 365.25 days long, it's really 365.2424 days long. If we added 
# a leap day every four years, we'd wind up getting ahead of our proper orbital position. 
# So once a century, we skip the leap year. Thus, for example, the year 2100 will not be a leap year.

# Still more: Skipping leap year once a century actually leaves us behind a bit. So every fourth century, 
# we don't skip the leap year. So while 2100 won't be a leap year, 2000 was.

# The math will never truly come out right, but with leap years, century years, and leap centuries, 
# we're within a day of being right for the next 30,000 years or so.
