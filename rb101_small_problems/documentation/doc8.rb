# One of the most commonly used mix-ins in ruby is the Enumerable module; it provides 
# uch of the functionality needed to iterate through collections such as Array, Hash, 
# and Range. If you look on the left-hand side of the documentation for the Array class, 
# you will see Enumerable listed under the heading of Included Modules. Click on Enumerable 
# to view the Enumerable documentation.
