# step(by: step, to: limit) { |i| block } â†’ self 
# The argument named :by is a "step" value, while the argument named :to is a limit. 
# The text below the signature shows that the "step" value indicates how much to increment 
# the index by with each iteration, while "limit" is the largest value; 
# if the index exceeds this value, the loop exits.
